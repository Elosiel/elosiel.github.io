And while it may be a popular winter destination, it is incredible in the warmer seasons. Camping at places such as Maroon Bells, Rocky Mountain National Park and Salida to name a few are some of the best places in the country to spend a night in a tent or cabin. Try spending the day horseback riding through the mountains for a amazing experience. Hiking is extremely popular and even try climbing a 14-er (mountain over 14,000 ft). If you want to hit up water, spend a day on boat at the many lakes, go tubing, or even get your heart rate up by&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.coloradowhitewaterrafting.com/\" target=\"_blank\">white water rafting</a>&nbsp;at Colorado Whitewater River Rafting!<br><s><br><br></s><br><em>IN CONCLUSION:</em><br><br>As you can see, there are tons of fun things to do in Colorado. The experiences here are full of beauty and adventure. Colorado is a hot spot all year around that everyone can enjoy. And might I mention, the vibe of the city is contagious.

And while it may be a popular winter destination, it is incredible in the warmer seasons.

And while it may be a popular winter destination, it is incredible in the warmer seasons.

Try spending the day horseback riding through the mountains for a amazing experience. Hiking is extremely popular and even try climbing a 14-er (mountain over 14,000 ft).
